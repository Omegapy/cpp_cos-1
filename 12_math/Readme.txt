1. Box Office

A movie theater only keeps a percentage of the revenue earned from ticket sales, the rest of the money goes to the movie distributor.  
Write a program that calculates the theater's gross (overall amount earned) 
and net (amount after the distributor's cut) box office profit for one night.  
The program should ask for the name of the movie and how many adult tickets and child tickets were sold.  
Adult tickets cost $12.00 each; seniors and children tickets cost $9.00 each. Students and Military with valid ID are $10.00 each.  
The theater keeps 20% of the ticket sales, the remainder goes to the distributor.  
Have the program display the information in the same format as the example below:

Movie Name:                     " Movie Name "
Adult Tickets Sold:                 ##
Senior/Child Tickets Sold:          ##
Student/Military Tickets Sold:      ##
Gross Box Office Profit:          $ ###.##
Net Box Office Profit:            $ ###.##
Amount Paid to Distributor:       $ ###.##
When finished, take a screen capture of your output and submit both the screen capture and your .cpp file in a zipped folder.

2. Monthly Payments

The monthly payment on a loan may be calculated with the following formula:
Payment = ((Rate * (1 + Rate) ^ N) / (((1 + Rate) ^ N) - 1)) * L     <- Note that no parenthesis comes after L!

Rate is the monthly interest rate, which is the annual interest rate divided by 12. N is the number of payments, 
and L is the amount of the loan. Write a program that asks for these values and displays a report similar to the following example:

Loan Amount:                       $ 10000.00
Annual Interest Rate:                 12%
Monthly Interest Rate:                 1%
Number of Payments:                   36
Monthly Payment:                   $ 332.14
Interest Paid:                     $ 1957.15
Total Amount Paid:                 $ 11957.15

DO NOT use the same numbers I did!  
When finished, take a screen capture of your output and submit both the screen capture and your .cpp file in a zipped folder.
