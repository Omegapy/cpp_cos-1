Program-2

2. Driver's License Exam Re-visit

Using the file "correctanswers.txt" populate the correct answers array for the drivers license exam program.  
Create a text file with the student answers, one letter per line (see the correct answers file for an example).  
Import the student answers from your text file into the program.  After the student answers have been imported, 
the program should compare the student answers to the correct answers and display a message indicating whether the student passed or failed the exam.  
(At least 15 correct answers are required to pass the exam.) Additionally, the total number of correctly answered questions,
and a list showing the question numbers of the questions the student got wrong should all be written to a new text file.

Turn in your .cpp file, student answers file, and final report text file as your submission; you do NOT need to turn in a screen capture.

NOTE:
You do not need an output text file for the first program. You do not need a screen capture for the second program.
When working with output files, some times you need to create the file yourself before the IDE can find it.  
Also the text files need to be in the same folder as your project. 
If you forget to include the correctanswer.txt or FORTUNES.txt files I have copies of those, 
but if you don't submit your student answer text file your program will not work.
