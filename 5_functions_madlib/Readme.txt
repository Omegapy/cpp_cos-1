5_functions_madlib

This is make - up work and is worth up to 40 points.It is NOT required.
Points will be earned entirely at the instructor's determination of program quality.

Write a program that gets words or phrases(as strings) from the user.
You will use the variables this data is stored in to insert and replace words or phrases in the lyrics of a song or parts of a poem.
The song or poem is of your own choice.It should be school friendly, if you need me to explain that, email / message me.

You should get at least two, but no more than five, of each of the following from the user :

nouns(things)
verbs(actions)
adjectives(description words)

You will need a function to get each of these different types of words. (That brings our total function count so far to 4; these three plus main.)

You will need to use a function to display the lyrics of the song as well as the name of the artist you most prefer to have sing it.
There can be lyrical differences between different artists.Include a URL to the lyrics as a comment in this function. (This brings our function count to 5.)
(Places like genius.com, azlyrics.com, songlyrics.com are best for this.
	Wikipedia is a 100 % no go.I will hit you with the Wikipedia penalty if you use it.
	Yes, even including a link to Wikipedia as a comment will invoke that penalty.)
	Pass the data you have gotten from the user to another function that displays your madlib.
	Examples of the output are below. (This brings our function count to 6. This is the minimum number of functions you need to get credit.)
	Separate the original lyrics from the madlib using a line of symbols of your choice. (*&# _ - etc.)

	Song / Poem Requirements :

School friendly.
Songs must be at least 1 verse plus the chorus.
Poems should be somewhat recognizable even after the minimum of 6 items have be injected. "Somewhat" is being left to your determination.
Do not use a haiku.
Do not expect any rhyme scheme from whatever you pick to be preserved.
