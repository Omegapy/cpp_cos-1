1. Sales

A small yard supply store has recently started selling new items. 
Write a program that lets the owner track which items are selling well and which ones are not. 
The items are as follows: clock radios, grills, umbrellas, patio furniture, holiday decorations, candy bars, garden gnomes and pet supplies.
The program should use two parallel arrays; 
an array of strings that holds the product names and an array of integers that holds the number of items sold during the past month for each type.  

The names should be stored in the array at the time the name array is created. Simply initialize the array with those items.  
The program should prompt the user to enter the number of items sold for each type.  
Once the sales data has been entered, the program should produce a report that displays sales for each item type, 
total sales, and the names of the highest selling and lowest selling products.
Yes, I am well aware that grills will not sell as well as candy bars. This assignment is not designed to reflect reality. 
*If you wish to use vectors in place of the arrays you may, be aware that vectors are much more difficult to sort.

INPUT VALIDATION: 
Do not accept negative values for the number of items sold.

Output Example:

	My Lawn Co. Sales Figures:
